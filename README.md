# Code-Quiz
A quiz for testing your coding knowledge! The fourth assignment in my coding bootcamp.



# Credits
    I used a ton of Mozilla, Github, and W3 resources to learn how to code this. The code for sorting the leaderboard is based on this article from geeksforgeeks.org: [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)
This project is unfinished -- I have requested an extension from the instructor.
