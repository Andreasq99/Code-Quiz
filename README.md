Once the game is over, you will be presented with your score and a button to head to the leaderboard page.

Once you have inputted your initials, you can head back to the main page to try again. If you leave early, "N/A" will be inputted as the initials for your score.

## Credits
I used a ton of Mozilla, Github, and W3 resources to learn how to code this. The code for sorting the leaderboard is based on this article from [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/).
